# BraaiBuddy
BraaiBuddy: Smart Monitoring and Notification System for use in a braai cooking environment.

This repository is for the personal continuation of my final year E&E Engineering project, in which I designed and built a smart device that monitors the internal temperatures of meat and the surface-level cooking temperatures while braaiing. The system can connect with a smart device where real-time temperature information is displayed, and preset selections can be made for the type of meat and the desired level of doneness.
